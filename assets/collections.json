In simple way, coherence describes similarity between two images in a range between zero to one. Zero means pixels were totally different where one means pixels were same exactly.The product algorithm starts from two ESA Level-1 SLC products which are from the same area, the same relative orbit number and preferably from within a short time interval (6 days is the shortest possible with S1A and S1B pairs). The original paired images go through a workflow of orbit correction, co-registration through back-geocoding, coherence calculation and terrain correction by making use of standard SNAP tools as part of the Sentinel-1 toolbox (S1TBX).The terrain correction step is intended to compensate for distortions due to topographical variations of the scene and the tilt of the satellite sensor, so that the geometric representation of the image will be as close as possible to the real world.\n\nThis product exposes properties to enable filtering on relative orbit number and orbit direction.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-56,180,83]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2015-07-06T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"TERRASCOPE_S1_SLC_COHERENCE_V1","license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/690755/Sentinel_Data_Legal_Notice","rel":"license"},{"href":"https://services.terrascope.be/catalogue/description?collection=urn:eop:VITO:TERRASCOPE_S1_SLC_COHERENCE_V1","rel":"alternate"},{"href":"https://services.terrascope.be/wmts/v2","rel":"wmts","wmts:layer":"CGS_S1_COHERENCE"}],"providers":[{"name":"VITO,

This dataset is based on the hourly ECMWF ERA5 data at surface level and is referred to as AgERA5. Acquisition and pre-processing of the original ERA5 data is a complex and specialized job. By providing the AgERA5 dataset, users are freed from this work and can directly start with meaningful input for their analyses and modelling. To this end, the variables provided in this dataset match the input needs of most agro-ecological models.\n\nData were aggregated to daily time steps at the local time zone and corrected towards a finer topography at a 0.1\u00b0 spatial resolution. The correction to the 0.1\u00b0 grid was realized by applying grid and variable-specific regression equations to the ERA5 dataset interpolated at 0.1\u00b0 grid. The equations were trained on ECMWF's operational high-resolution atmospheric model (HRES) at a 0.1\u00b0 resolution. This way the data is tuned to the finer topography, finer land use pattern and finer land-sea delineation of the ECMWF HRES model.\n\nThe data was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThis dataset is marked as experimental because the integration in this backend has not yet been fully validated.
